# Bayesian Methods: From Theory to Real-World Applications
A Practical Guide to Using Bayesian Techniques in A/B Testing and Uplift Modeling
The Bayesian approach is commonly applied in fields such as finance, marketing, and medicine. In this paper, I focus on how it can be used for A/B testing.
I begin with a simple example to explain Bayes' Theorem and show how it helps handle uncertainty and make better decisions.
Next, I discuss how Bayesian testing differs from traditional methods like t-tests and why it can be more effective for analyzing A/B test results.
The main part of the paper explores Bayesian A/B testing in marketing, particularly with uplift models, comparing its performance to traditional approaches.
Finally, I share the results and business insights, highlighting how Bayesian methods support smarter decision-making in uncertain situations.
